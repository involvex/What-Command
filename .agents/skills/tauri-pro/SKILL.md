    Production-grade Tauri desktop (and mobile): Rust core, invoke/commands, capabilities/permissions, webview integration, bundling, updater, and cross-platform edge cases — plus system model (Rust host + webview, IPC invoke/events, capabilities as ACL, threading), failure modes (over-broad capabilities, shell injection, path traversal, IPC payload jank, WebView2/CSP prod surprises), decision trade-offs (sidecar vs in-process, Tauri vs Electron, bundled vs remote UI, desktop vs mobile), and quality guardrails (Tauri 1 vs 2 config accuracy, safe errors, release-build parity).

    Use this skill for Tauri (`src-tauri`, `#[tauri::command]`, `invoke`, `tauri.conf`, plugins, updater, sidecars), Rust–frontend boundaries, or packaging for Windows/macOS/Linux (and mobile when applicable).

    Combine with **`react-pro`** (or Vue/Svelte) for webview UI, **`typescript-pro`** for typed invoke contracts, **`security-pro`** for capabilities/CSP/shell hardening, **`testing-pro`** for CI and E2E, **`deployment-pro`** for signing and updater pipelines, **`performance-tuning-pro`** for IPC/startup, and **`docker-pro`** for cross-compile CI.

    Triggers: "Tauri", "tauri", "src-tauri", "tauri.conf", "invoke", "tauri::command", "WebView", "WebView2", "Rust desktop", "Tauri plugin", "Tauri updater", "capability", "Tauri 2", "v1", "v2", "sidecar", "Cargo.toml".

# Tauri (professional)

Skill text is **English**; answer in the user’s preferred language when rules or the conversation specify it.

Use official [Tauri documentation](https://tauri.app/) for the user’s **major version** (1 vs 2); this skill encodes **IPC boundaries**, **capability hygiene**, and **shipping** concerns — not generic SPA tutorials. Confirm **Tauri major**, **Rust toolchain**, and **frontend** stack (e.g. Vite + React).

Webview UI patterns: **`react-pro`** when using React.

## Boundary

**`tauri-pro`** owns **Tauri configuration**, **Rust commands**, **capabilities/plugins**, **packaging/updater**, and **webview host integration**. **`react-pro`** owns **component-level web UI**. **`electron-pro`** applies only to **Electron** codebases. **`deployment-pro`** owns **org-wide signing/release policy** beyond Tauri-specific steps.

## Related skills (this repo)

| Skill | When to combine |
|-------|----------------|
| **`react-pro`** | SPA in webview — hooks, state, a11y |
| **`typescript-pro`** | Typed `invoke` payloads and shared types |
| **`security-pro`** | CSP, capabilities, shell/fs/open policies |
| **`testing-pro`** | Rust tests, E2E on packaged app, CI |
| **`deployment-pro`** | Signing, notarization, updater channels |
| **`performance-tuning-pro`** | IPC size, startup, memory |
| **`docker-pro`** | Cross-compile in CI |
| **`electron-pro`** | Stack comparison only — not Tauri impl |

## When to use

- Rust **`#[tauri::command]`** design, `invoke` contracts, error mapping to UI.
- **Capabilities** / permissions (Tauri 2) or legacy allowlists — least privilege.
- **Bundling**, **updater**, **sidecars**, platform webview differences.
- Async vs blocking commands; large payload patterns.

## When not to use

- **Pure React** question with no Tauri/Rust — **`react-pro`**.
- **Electron app** — **`electron-pro`**.
- **Generic Rust** with no Tauri APIs — narrow to Tauri or defer to Rust ecosystem docs.

## Required inputs

- **Tauri major** (1 vs 2) and **target OS** (desktop vs mobile).
- **Rust version** / MSRV when suggesting features.

## Expected output

Follow **Suggested response format** strictly — system model through residual risks.

## Workflow

Apply **Karpathy principles** throughout: Think Before Coding, Simplicity First, Surgical Changes, Goal-Driven Execution.

1. **Confirm** Tauri major, Rust toolchain, platforms, and frontend stack. → verify: [context documented].
2. **State assumptions** about requirements, constraints (**Think Before Coding**).
3. **Apply** minimum solution first; escalate only when justified (**Simplicity First**).
4. **Make surgical changes** — only touch code directly related to the request (**Surgical Changes**).
5. **Define success criteria**; loop until verified (**Goal-Driven Execution**).
6. **Respond** using **Suggested response format**; note main risks.

### Operating principles

- Start by confirming **Tauri major version** and platform, because config and capabilities differ materially.
- Keep the **Rust host / webview boundary** explicit; do not smear app logic across IPC casually.
- Prefer the **least-privileged capability and plugin** setup that still solves the requirement.
- Optimize for **release-build correctness** over dev-mode convenience.
- Escalate to sidecars, shell access, or filesystem breadth only when the simpler in-process path is insufficient.

## Suggested response format

Use this structure for Tauri work:

1. **Context and version** — Tauri major, frontend stack, target OS, packaging/updater scope.
2. **System model** — Rust host, commands/events, capabilities, plugin or sidecar boundaries.
3. **Priority risks** — capability sprawl, unsafe shell/fs access, IPC shape, packaging drift.
4. **Recommended changes** — minimal code/config updates ordered by safety and impact.
5. **Verification plan** — dev vs release checks, platform-specific validation, signing/updater tests if relevant.
6. **Residual risks** — remaining platform gaps or version-sensitive assumptions.

- `references/rust-core-and-commands.md` — Rust command patterns and command-boundary design.
- `references/failure-modes-detection-mitigation.md` — common Tauri production failures.
- `references/edge-cases.md` — platform-specific behavior and release surprises.
- `references/quality-validation-and-guardrails.md` — least-privilege and release-parity guardrails.

## Quick example

User asks: "Our Tauri app works in dev but the file-open command fails in packaged Windows builds."

Response shape:
- Confirm Tauri major, capability model, and packaged build behavior.
- Inspect whether the failure is permission/capability related, path related, or shell/plugin related.
- Propose the smallest safe config/code changes first.
- Verify in a packaged build rather than stopping at dev-mode success.

## Checklist before calling the skill done

- Tauri version and platform assumptions are explicit.
- Rust/webview responsibilities are clearly separated.
- Capability and plugin recommendations follow least privilege.
- Verification covers packaged/release behavior, not only dev mode.
- Version-sensitive assumptions are called out.
